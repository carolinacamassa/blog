	<p>I read articles on Medium almost every day. I owe a lot of my personal knowledge to that platform, but here&rsquo;s what I think: If you know how to program, even just a little, and you write semi-regularly on Medium, you should stop doing that and open your own blog instead.</p>
<hr>
<p>You might be wondering what’s wrong with writing on Medium, so the first part of this post is devoted to explaining my reasons. If you’re convinced, the second part will act as a roadmap you can follow to strike out on your own.</p>
<p>I’m not by far the first person to come up with these thoughts. A growing number of people share my disillusionment with the platform - and funnily enough, some of them write about in on Medium.
However, in case you don’t have any idea why writing all your articles on Medium is not ideal, let me list three reasons:</p>
<h4 id="content-ownership">Content ownership</h4>
<p>Your posts are owned by Medium. They don’t have the <em>rights</em> to them, of course, so they can’t, say, repost them without your name. But if by any chance the platform went bust tomorrow, all your articles, comments, and applauses would vanish along with it. And if your online presence is based mainly there, this would be a very bad thing.</p>
<p>Of course, I don’t see that happening anytime soon: Medium seems to be healthy and triving. But if you are at least a bit serious about blogging, it should worry you that your content, and whatever reputation you’ve built around it, is not under your control.</p>
<h4 id="the-paywall">The paywall</h4>
<p>Medium is a business, and as such they need a way to make money. Instead of relying on advertising, they’ve decided to include a premium membership - at about 5$ a month - that allows users to read unlimited amounts of “premium” articles. People who don’t pay the membership fee can only read a limited number of these articles every month - I think the number is 5 at the moment.</p>
<p>Premium content is selected by Medium, not by the writer, and apparently writers can get paid something if their articles are put behind the paywall.<br>
I personally think - and you might disagree with me - that the possibility of getting money from publishing articles isn’t worth it, if you stack it against the other drawbacks of the platform.<br>
The value of having your content in a website of your own, with your name on it, might be greater than whatever Medium can pay you. Not to mention that by sharing your articles freely, you are reaching more people and providing  more value and knowledge.</p>
<h4 id="personal-branding-or-lack-thereof">Personal branding (or lack thereof)</h4>
<p>Even though I don’t write there, I still read a lot of articles on Medium, mainly on data science and technology. At some point I realized that I never paid any attention to the writer’s name. I could be reading 10 articles in a week without even knowing if some of them were written by the same person.</p>
<p>Medium definitely encourages this anonimization. There is no relevant way - as far as I know - to personalize your content. At the beginning, users could set a custom domain, but now that’s not possible anymore. So, what are your articles good for is no one even notices that they’re written by you?<br>
That may sound a little cynical: maybe you believe that the pleasure of sharing your knowledge with others should be enough.
But I think that most people who take the time from their day to write an article want to get at least <em>some</em> recognition for it, even if they decide to share it free of charge.</p>
<p>Having your own blog doesn’t leave the readers any doubts about the author’s identity (if you do it right). There are so many options to customize your own corner of the Internet and to make it feel like “you”, and it provides a single place to store your content and grow your online presence without having to worry about external decisions.</p>
<hr>
<p>Of course, there’s a big factor that keeps people on Medium: it gets you <strong>traffic</strong>. If you start a blog on a personal domain, it will take time and effort for you to get a steady stream of visitors. Medium is  an established platform trusted by search engines, so your articles will get found much more easily if you post them there.</p>
<p>However, this brings us again to the <strong>control</strong> argument: what if Medium changes its algorithm, like these platforms often do, and your statistics suddenly go down?</p>
<p>What if they decide to put everything behind a paywall, so only a fraction of the public gets to see your content? What if they get acquired and change their mission?</p>
<p>If some of these arguments sound reasonable, you might want to read on for the “okay, how do I build my own blog?” part.</p>
<h3 id="static-web-sites">Static web sites</h3>
<p>In the web development community, using a static site generator for personal websites and blogs has become a no-brainer. In case you&rsquo;re not familiar with the concept,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A static web page (sometimes called a flat page or a stationary page) is a web page that is delivered to the user&rsquo;s web browser exactly as stored, in contrast to dynamic web pages which are generated by a web application.
<sub>Source: Wikipedia</sub></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A Wordpress blog, for example, isn’t static. When you visit it, a call to a database is made to load the articles and other content. The main advantage of static web sites is that they’re much lighter, so they’re cheaper to host. In fact, you can host them for free: there are two platforms, Github Pages and Netlify, that allow you to publish a static website from a Github repository at no cost.</p>
<p>The main drawback is that a static site has to be “re-built” every time you add more content. Luckily, you can use a static site generator that makes all these operations very easy, even if you have no web development knowledge. I’ll talk about generators in the next section.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>While hosting a static website with Github Pages or Netlify is free, customized domains usually aren’t. If you want a professional domain like yourname.com, you’ll probably have to pay for it. But domains typically cost about 20 euros per year, and they’re a good investment in personal branding.</em></p>
<h3 id="choosing-a-static-site-generator">Choosing a static site generator</h3>
<p>A static site generator takes care of building your site from a template. You can usually choose from an array of pre-built themes - which are customizable if you know some HTML/CSS. Then you just need to put your content files in a folder and run a “build” command from your command line. That’s basically it.</p>
<p>There are a lot of generators out there. I’ve decided to stick to just three options - I didn’t want this article to become just another laundry list. All three are established and widely used, so you should have no surprises, and they have documentation that’s easy enough to follow for beginners.I will link the respective Getting Started guide for each option, as this post is not intended to be a technical tutorial.</p>
<p class = "callout info">These three frameworks are written using different programming languages, but the language doesn’t actually matter when you’re using them, unless you’re planning on tinkering with the source code - which you really don’t need to do to build a blog.</p>
<img src = "/blog/uploads/staticsite_generators.png" width="73%">
<p>The static site generator ecosystem is quite large: if you’re curious about what other choices there are, check out <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">this page</a>.</p>
<h4 id="hugo">Hugo</h4>
<p>Hugo is written in Go. It’s what I used for this blog, and I think it offers a nice balance between flexibility and simplicity. The documentation is well written, it’s widely used and there a lot of nice pre-made themes available.<br>
It natively supports some useful widgets that add dynamic functionalities to your site, like the share buttons for social networks and the disqus comment section.</p>
<p><a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">Hugo Getting Started Guide</a></p>
<h4 id="jekyll">Jekyll</h4>
<p>It was created by one of Github&rsquo;s co-founders, and it’s written in Ruby. The Jekyll + Github Pages combo is a popular choice and it powers a good chunk of developer blogs. It leans more towards simplicity compared to the other two frameworks, so if you’re looking for something basic to get you started quickly, this is a great choice.</p>
<p><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/">Jekyll Getting Started Guide</a></p>
<h4 id="gatsby-js">Gatsby JS</h4>
<p>Even though it’s the newest of the three, I’ve seen more and more people use Gatsby.<br>
Gatsby is powered by NodeJS and has more features than Hugo and Jekyll, stuff like Progressive Image Loading and prefetching of links. None of these are necessary for a simple blog or personal website, but if you have some web development experience and you want to have a more sophisticated end product, it might be the perfect choice.</p>
<p>Of course, you can still use it if you are a beginner and create a beautiful site, but some of its key features might be lost on you (as they are lost on me).</p>

<h3 id="writing-your-content">Writing your content</h3>
<p>Once your blog&rsquo;s skeleton is finally ready - or ideally before that - it would be nice to have something to put in it.</p>
<p>The default file format for posts uploaded to static blogs is Markdown. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with it, Markdown is a very popular <em>markup language</em> with numerous applications. For example, text cells in Jupyter Notebooks are written in Markdown.<br>
It’s very simple: 10 minutes should be enough to know everything you need to know. Markdown is great for developers and tech writers, because it supports code highlighting and makes it easier to embed code.<br>
Also, if you work with Jupyter Notebooks, you can directly convert them to Markdown from the Notebook interface, with is convenient.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/uploads/markdown.gif" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="markdown-editors">Markdown editors</h3>
<p>I decided to dedicate a small part of this post to Markdown editors because I think the right editor can dramatically improve your writing experience.
You can actually use any code editor to write in Markdown, but if you’re looking for something fancier and more comfortable, here is my selection (all of these are free).</p>

<hr>
<p>I hope you found this small guide/opinion piece interesting. Let me know if you decide to create your own blog or personal website, I’ll be happy to check it out!</p>
<p>I’ll leave you with this nice quote about blogging, and writing in general:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And don’t concern yourself with whether or not you “write.” Don’t leave writing to writers. Don’t delegate your area of interest and knowledge to people with stronger rhetorical resources. You’ll find your voice as you make your way. There is, however, one thing to learn from writers that non-writers don’t always understand. Most writers don’t write to express what they think. They write to figure out what they think. Writing is a process of discovery. Blogging is an essential tool toward meditating over an extended period of time on a subject you consider to be important.<br>
